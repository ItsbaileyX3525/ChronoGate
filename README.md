This is just a rather complex but fun little/big project im doing.

The aim of the game, so far, is to level up by beating enemies and obtaining all the magic you can.
The current spells list of spells that will be in the game are as follows:
- Time stop
- Fire casting
- Water casting
- Shadow stuff
- Light stuff
- And other stuff

Right now the current mechanics as of 06/07/2023 (UK) is:
- Character naming
- Menu screens, pausing etc.
- Keybinds
- Spell playground
- Basic fighting
- Settings

There will be plenty of enemies to fight to level up and its all built with python and ursina! ENJOY!!
